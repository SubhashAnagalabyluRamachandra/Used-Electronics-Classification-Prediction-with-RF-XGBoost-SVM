# Classification of Used Electronics into Budget-Friendly or Feature-Intensive Categories Using Machine Learning Algorithms
This classification project focuses on utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to categorize used electronics into two distinct classes: Budget-Friendly and Feature-Intensive. 

# Dataset
The project leverages a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes of used electronic devices, such as brand, operating system, screen size, camera specifications, internal memory, RAM, battery capacity, weight, release year, days used, and normalized price metrics. Each electronic device is labeled as either Budget-Friendly or Feature-Intensive based on a set of predefined conditions.
